# Semantic_Segmentation
This repo compare several methods to defect classificaton and detecton. The dataset I used is [DAGM 2007](https://conferences.mpi-inf.mpg.de/dagm/2007/prizes.html) . 


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Keras 2.4.3
* Tensorflow 2.2.0
* Coco API
* Opencv for python


## Usage via command line

### Training the Model 


### Training Stats
The training set is coco/train2017 and the validation set is coco/val2017. The pretained model under model is getting 96.42% accuracy for training set and 92.9% accuracy for validation set. 

### Inference
